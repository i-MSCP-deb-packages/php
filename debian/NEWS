php5.4 (5.4.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Several extensions have been split into separate extension packages:
   - php-dba - Database (dbm-style) Abstraction Layer
   - php-mbstring - Multibyte String
   - php-soap - SOAP
   - php-xml - DOM, SimpleXML, WDDX, XML, XMLReader and XMLWriter
   - php-zip - Zip
  * The new packages are not installed automatically, so you will need to
    install them by hand, if you use the functions in those modules.
  * Most modules that have been builtin before are now included in
    phpX.Y-common package and they are enabled by default for your
    convenience.  You can disabled unneeded modules via phpdismod tool.
  * Build of php-imap extension has been disabled due to conflict with newest
    libc-client2007e package (build against openssl 1.1 but << 1.1 expected).
