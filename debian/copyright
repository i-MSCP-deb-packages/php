License: CC0
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
 confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon
 the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
 original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural
 and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and
 without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify,
 incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as
 possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including
 without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
 to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
 production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the
 use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he
 or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may
    be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
    ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
    include, but are not limited to, the following:
 .
  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
      performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
       likeness depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
      Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
     data in a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
      on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
      implementation thereof, including any amended or successor
      version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout
       the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
       implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
    contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
    permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
    surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
    associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
    unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
    action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for
    the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
    (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
    whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising
    or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver
    for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
    detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
    such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission,
    cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action
    to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
    contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
    law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
    permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
    Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
    Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
    transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
    unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related
    Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
    for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
    including without limitation commercial, advertising or
    promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
    effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
    Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged
    legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
    invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
    of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he
    or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright
    and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated
    claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
    case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
