Description: Don't run git-clean via buildconf
 Calling buildconf indirectly invokes vcsclean, which calls the gitclean-work
 target of build/build.mk, which calls among other things git clean -X -f -d,
 which in turn nukes the quilt .pc directory making life quite difficult for
 us.
 .
 This patch doesn't need to go upstream, as they likely don't want to support
 having a patch system on top of their source.
